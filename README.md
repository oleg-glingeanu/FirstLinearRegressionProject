# My First Linear Regression Project
My first Machine Learning project using Linear Regression Algorithm
- I imported the csv data file from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+metrics
- Cleaned the data and replaced any number that is NaN to 0
- Used the Linear Regression Algorithm to predict Page total likes
